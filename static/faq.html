        <h2>What's Studybuddy?</h2>
        <p>As a college student, there's a million ways to get help in classes. But a lot of them are time-limited, a hassle to set up, or cost money. Studybuddy is a service that pairs or groups students into study groups based on classes, to help you study and get help more flexibly, more effectively, with less distractions.</p>
        <p>Right now, we're just starting out with some pilot experiments for a few popular classes at Cal, trying to make sure we have something that's actually helpful, and making sure we iron out any kinks in our service. But eventually, we hope to open up Studybuddy to all of Cal and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Who's behind this?</h2>
        <p>Us! We're a team of two Cal undergraduate students. Linus is studying computer scienec, and Divyansh is pre-Haas at Berkeley. You can reach out to us <a href="/contact">here</a> for any questions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="questionGroup">
        <h2>Why do you ask so many questions to sign up?</h2>
        <p>We only need to know your name, email, and class to match you with a studybuddy. But we can do a better job of ensuring that your study partners / groups are productive if we know a little more about you, like when you're available and how you're doing in the class, so we've made those optional questions.</p>

      <div class="questionGroup">
        <h2>I want help on a class and it isn't listed! What do I do?</h2>
        <p>We're just starting out with Studybuddy, so while we'd love to open it up to everyone, we want to first make sure we get everything right before making it widely available. To do that, we're first opening up Studybuddy to some of the biggest classes at Cal, like CS 61A and Math 1A/B, and making Studybuddy better based on the feedback we get from students in those classes.</p>
        <p>Eventually, our plan is to open it up to everyone at Cal, for any class anywhere. But in the meanwhile, if you want to use Studybuddy but can't find your class here, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know! We'll be opening up additional classes based on demand.</p>

        <h2>I want to use Studybuddy, but I'm not from UC Berkeley! What do I do?</h2>
        <p>We're just starting out with Studybuddy, so while we'd love to open it up to everyone, we want to firs tmake sure we get everything right before making it widely available. To do that, we're first experimenting with some of the biggest classes at Berkeley, and making Studybuddy better and more helpful based on the feedback we get from students in those classes</p>
        <p>Eventually, we hope to make Studybuddy available everywhere, for any student. But in the meanwhile, if you want to use Studybuddy but aren't at Cal, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know where you're from! We're planning on expanding to other campuses based on demand.</p>
