        <em>Studybuddy</em> is closing down.
      </h1>

      <p>Studybuddy was a service I spun up as a class project during my first year at UC Berkeley in 2018. After the course ended, I kept it running for a while because I noticed a few classmates continuing to use it. But with <a href="https://thesephist.com/projects/">a full list of side projects to maintain</a>, Studybuddy wasn't top of mind for me to keep up and running indefinitely, and for people looking for study mates, there were (obviously) better options on the market.</p>
      <p>Studybuddy has stayed up for the last three years, mostly because I haven't had the time to update the app or take it down officially. But with a trickle of new people using Studybuddy and the prevalence of spam and abuse, I've chosen to stop maintaining Studybuddy.</p>
      <p>If you've tried Studybuddy in the past, thank you! And if you want to keep track of what I'm currently building, you can find me at <a href="https://thesephist.com">thesephist.com</a>, tinkering away.</p>
      <p>- Linus, Studybuddy</p>
